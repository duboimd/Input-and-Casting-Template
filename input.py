#Input and Casting Practice
# Complete the following to demonstrate your learning about input and casting.
print("Number 1:")
# 1. Ask the user for their name using input. Then store their name in a variable called name and print their name.


print("Number 2:")
# 2. Ask the user for their age using input and store it in a variable called age. Then print their age.


print("Number 3:")
# 3. Now print a full sentence using the variables name and age and format it using a print statement and commas! Example: Hello _____ (name)! You are ____ (age) years old!
# Hint: remember we can combine strings and variables in print statements! For example: print(“Hello”,name)


print("Number 4:")
# 4. Ask the user to enter their favourite color using input and store it in a variable called userColor. Then print that color.


print("Number 5:")
# 5. Ask the user to enter their lucky number using input (remember to cast it to an int) then store that in a variable called userNumber. 


print("Number 6:")
# 6. Ask the user for a number using input (remember to cast it to an int), store it in a variable called num and then add 10 to it. Then print num.


print("Number 7:")
# 7. Ask the user for the year that they were born in using input and store it in a variable called birthYear. Then, print their current age. 
# For example, if you were born in 2010, today you are 12 years old because 2022 - 2010 = 12


print("Number 8:")
# 8. Pretend you are a cashier at a grocery store. Using input, ask the user for their total amount. Calculate the tax on the amount (assuming the tax is 13% -> total*1.13). Print the total including the tax.
